                    Worrying thoughts of whether or not I'm actually an abusive person, that CIs was right about me, that I am a terrible
                    person and Lyn should have left me. Self hating on myself for being a terrible person, and asking Lyn whether or not I was
                    abusive. The sadness comes from where she kinda told me to either stop talking about it or just go to TMOM's ranting channel.

                    Thanks to her dad I can't call her so we had to go without the call and I hated
                    myself for missing our call.
